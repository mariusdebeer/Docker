<h1>WordPress with MySQL & PHPMyAdmin<h1>

This is to run WordPress with MySQL.  For added benefit, I have included PHPMyAdmin if you need to import an existing database.

!IMPORTANT! You need to edit the .env file and create secure passwords for your database & database user before running this in production.
