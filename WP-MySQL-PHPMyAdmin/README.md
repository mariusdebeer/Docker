<h3>WordPress with MySQL & PHPMyAdmin<h3>

<p>This is to run WordPress with MySQL.  For added benefit, I have included PHPMyAdmin if you need to import an existing database.

  <strong>!IMPORTANT!</strong> You need to edit the .env file and create secure passwords for your database & database user before running this in production.</p>
